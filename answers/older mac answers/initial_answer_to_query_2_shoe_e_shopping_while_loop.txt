the number of tokens in the task + query is:  44
we added  16  (prompts, completions), where prompts are the most similar to the actual prompt
the number of tokens in the actual prompt is:  2710

The last 100 characters of the actual prompt are: 

s of users, products, shopping events and users balance, 
and with relations between these. output: 
The GPT 3 engine responds with:  
1. Create a blueprint project: x then choose x:project (creates a project using x) \n 
2. cd project npm install and npm run blueprint:generate. This creates two microservices: api, which contains MongoDB and graphQL interfaces powered by XFramework and the admin powered by Webpack, React and Ant Design. It will generate: Server-side: Collections \n Models \n GraphQL Types \n GraphQL CRUDs \n Queries and Mutations for CRUDs \n Custom GraphQL Inputs \n Subscription & Live Data Ready \n Client-side: \n UI Collections \n For Isomorphic Interaction with MongoDB \n CRUD Admin Pages \n Lists with Search, Pagination and Complex Filters \n Edit Forms \n Create Forms \n Easy Deletion \n 
3. Create the collections for users, products, shopping events and users balance: 
app({
  collections: [
    collection({
      id: "Users",
      fields: [
        field({
          id: "name",
          type: fields.types.STRING,
        }),
        field({
          id: "balance",
          type: fields.types.NUMBER,
        }),
      ],
    }),
    collection({
      id: "Products",
      fields: [
        field({
          id: "name",
          type: fields.types.STRING,
        }),
        field({
          id: "price",
          type: fields.types.NUMBER,
        }),
      ],
    }),
    collection({
      id: "ShoppingEvents",
      fields: [
        field({
          id: "name",
          type: fields.types.STRING,
        }),
        field({
          id: "date",
          type: fields.types.DATE,
        }),
      ],
    }),
    collection({
      id: "UsersBalance",
      fields: [
        field({
          id: "amount",
          type: fields.types.NUMBER,
        }),
        field({
          id: "date",
          type: fields.types.DATE,
        }),
      ],
    }),
  ],
});

4. Create the relations between the collections: 
app({
  collections: [
    collection({
      id: "Users",
      fields: [],
      relations: [
        relation({
          id: "products",
          to: "Products",
          isMany: true,
        }),
        relation({
          id: "shoppingEvents",
          to: "ShoppingEvents",
          isMany: true,
        }),
        relation({
          id: "usersBalance",
          to: "UsersBalance",
          isMany: true,
        }),
      ],
    }),
    collection({
      id: "Products",
      fields: [],
      relations: [
        relation({
          id: "user",
          to: "Users",
        }),
      ],
    }),
    collection({
      id: "ShoppingEvents",
      fields: [],
      relations: [
        relation({
          id: "user",
          to: "Users",
        }),
      ],
    }),
    collection({
      id: "UsersBalance",
      fields: [],
      relations: [
        relation({
          id: "user",
          to: "Users",
        }),
      ],
    }),
  ],
});

5. Generate the project: 
generateProject(application);
(openai)
